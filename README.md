# Revived History

**Revived History** is a mod for *Europa Universalis IV* (EU4) that overhauls the colonization system (AI) to provide a more historically plausible and immersive experience. 

The mod restructures colonial expansion patterns, introduces new colonial regions, adds alternative historical paths, and expands mission trees for key nations. A major focus of the project was **overhauling the AI behavior** — creatively working around limitations in the EU4 engine and scripting system to make colonial nations behave in a way that aligns more closely with historical trends.

To ensure historical accuracy while maintaining gameplay balance, I conducted extensive research into real-world colonization patterns, political developments, and historical timelines. This historical foundation supports a richer and more believable alt-history experience.
